## ProTect
### General Information:
ProTect is a browser extension developed to study the placebo effect in
privacy and security related settings in computer science. 
During the study the extension was used as a placebo extension to investigate
if users will be able to distinguish an extension with actual functionality
from an extension without functionality. Therefore, ProTect uses random generated
numbers instead of the actually blocked tracker value in its statistics. 


### Installation:
1. Download the "Main" branch of this repository
2. Install the fonts provided in the "fonts" folder
   (Works without it, but does not look as pretty)
3. Open Chrome/Chromium and navigate to the "Extensions" page
4. Enable development mode
5. Choose "load unpacked extension" and select the root folder of the downloaded branch
6. Enable the extension

**Disclaimer:** Because it is used as part of the placebo condition ProTect has NO privacy protecting
features built in and is NOT functioning in the way it was advertised during the study.
Therefore, it is also not available through the Chrome Webstore and should be used with caution.
For more information on the actual features of the extension have a look at the "Documentation" folder.
