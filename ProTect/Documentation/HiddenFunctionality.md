#### This Extension is NOT a Privacy Protection Extension. 

#### The actual functionality of the plugin is as follows:
- Logs Clicks, URL and Tab changes in the console of the service_worker
- Shows random generated numbers in the "blocked privacy breaches" area of the PopUp
- The activation button in the PopUp page is not disabling the extension. 
It is just there to manipulate users into thinking that the extension is not active.


#### Future additions/work in progress:
- Logs will be saved on the personal computer
